Copyright:

Amulet is available for free by anonymous FTP or  WWW. Amulet has been
put into the public domain. This means that anyone  can use Amulet for
whatever they  want. In particular, Amulet  can be used for commercial
development without any license or   fees. The resulting binaries  and
libraries can  also be  distributed  commercially or  for free without
payments or licenses to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). You can even
include   portions of the Amulet   source  code  in  your projects  or
products. The only restriction is that the documentation for Amulet is
copyrighted, so   you cannot distribute the   Amulet manual  or papers
without permission from CMU. In return,  CMU assumes no responsibility
for how  well Amulet  works, and  will not  guarantee  to  provide any
support.   If you need more  formal  legal language,  see Section 1.12
below.  If you need this  formally signed, then replace your company's
name for COMPANY and send it back to us.

Of  course, the Amulet  research group would  appreciate any corporate
grants or donations to support the further development and maintenance
of Amulet. We would also be interested in discussing grants to support
adding specific features to the system  that would make it more useful
for your needs. Please contact Brad Myers at bam@cs.cmu.edu to discuss
this.

If you decide to use Amulet, we would like to  be able to mention this
in our publicity and reports to our  sponsors. (We get recognition for
having users, both commercial and research projects.) Please send mail
to amulet@cs.cmu.edu with the name of your project or product. We also
like to   receive screenshots. If you   write papers or advertisements
about systems built with Amulet, we would appreciate if you included a
mention that you used  Amulet, and a  reference to this manual, and we
would like a copy of your paper for our files.
